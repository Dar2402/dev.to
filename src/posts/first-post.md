# How to Build a React Blog from Scratch

Creating a blog from scratch with React is easier than you think.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll use:

- Vite for project setup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Markdown for blog content
- Context API + useReducer for state

## ðŸ§± Setting Up the Project

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-blog -- --template react
cd react-blog
npm install
